# Archicrate

At Slalom Build, we are all builders. Each discipline has unique perspectives and experiences to offer when building best-fit Cloud Architectures.

The inspiration for **Archicrate** is to create in-person collaboration activies about Cloud Architecture. The journey to grinding out Certificates doesn't need to be so lonely.

The goal of **Archicrate** is to collaboratively build a Cloud Architecture based on a real-world customer need. Players will answer trivia questions to earn Cloud Coins, which they will use to purchase Service Tiles and build the Architecture together.

## Theme
