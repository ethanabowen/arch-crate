# Archicrate

At Slalom Build, we are all builders. Each discipline has unique perspectives and experiences to offer when building best-fit Cloud Architectures.

The inspiration for **Archicrate** is to create in-person collaboration activies about Cloud Architecture. The journey to grinding out Certificates doesn't need to be so lonely.

The goal of **Archicrate** is to collaboratively build a Cloud Architecture based on a real-world customer need. Players will answer trivia questions to earn Cloud Coins, which they will use to purchase Service Tiles and build the Architecture together.

## Gameplay Styles

### Group/Solo

- Trivia Phase - Answer 5 questions (easy - hard) to collect Cloud Coins
- Build Phase
  - Read Architecture proposal/pitch.
  - Spend your Cloud Coins on Service Tiles you think are apart of the architecture. If you can't purchase all the ones you need, that's ok. Explain that as you build.
  - Build the Architecture on a white-board or table.
    - Use the dry erase markers to connect the components together
  - Review Architecture answer and discuss.

### Education Mode

- The Reference Architecture binder is a curated list of Architectures that cover real-world customer uses of the Cloud.
- These can be used or presented at the beginning of a session as a warm-up conversation.
- Exposure is key to education!
